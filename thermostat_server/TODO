Have a dictionary of deques instead of hard programming one for each room.
The dictionary will use the room string as the key and a deque as the value.
I will need to adjust how data is collected and how to determine what mode the thermostat needs to be in.

I need to figure out how to get the ip address for the server, but not the loopback ip address.
